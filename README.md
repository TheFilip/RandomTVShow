# RandomTVShow
A simple program to play TV shows like cable-tv channels.


I got bored choosing TV show to watch, so I made this. Not the cleanest or easiliest (yup, thats not misspelled) at customizing. The program ultimately does what it was made to do.



req:
-firefox in c:drive, otherwise change location
-insert videos
